	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> What is The Nail Art? </p></h3>
	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> Nail art is a creative way to paint, decorate, enhance, and embellish nails. It is a type of artwork that can be done on fingernails and toenails, usually after manicures or pedicures. </p></h3>
	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> Acrylic nails </p></h3>
	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> Acrylic nails are created using a mixture of acrylic powder and liquid monomer. They provide a more durable and complex design option compared to traditional nail polish, but are also more difficult to apply and remove, and can be more expensive </p></h3>
	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> Gel nails </p></h3>
	<h3 style="background: #F0F0D5"> <p> Gel nails are created using a gel that is cured under UV light. They are similarly durable and complex in design to acrylic nails, but can be more costly. Application and removal processes are similar to those for acrylic nails. </p></h3>
